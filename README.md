# UFO Sightings

## Overview

In order to organize UFO data stored as a JavaScript array within a user-friendly app, we created a table that has the ability to filter data based on certain criteria.

## Results

Scrolling down the page, past the introduction, you will see five different filter options for the accompanying	table: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape:

The formatting for the filter options are provided as place holder in each search bar. You can enter a specific criteria in any search bar to find UFO sightings that match. You can even add multiple criteria to narrow your search! See below for an example:

For the example above, the search result should look like this. It looks like we have a match!

## Summary

Although our app works and we can easily filter through the table to find corresponding UFO sightings, we are limited by the amount of data provided. Without scrolling through the table initially, it might be hard to find a specific UFO sighting just off of search criteria.

One improvement we can make would be to include more UFO sightings from a wider range of dates, as well as locations. This would provide a more robust table that would be less limited in the information it can provide

Another improvement would be to include a link column that would route the user to an account or a news article corresponding to the UFO sighting. This would provide more user interact-ability while also giving the user much more information than we can provide by the table.
